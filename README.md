# TELBlazor-CodeReport
This repo has a workflow that receives an artifact and hosts a code report. It is triggered by a TELBlazor repo workflow.

# Notes

There is one gh-pages per repo so this second repo uses artifacts when triggered by the pipeline to allow test environment.
Artifacts are automatic deleted after a period of time.
